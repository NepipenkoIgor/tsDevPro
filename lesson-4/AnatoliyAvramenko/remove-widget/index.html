                    Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software 
                    and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed 
                    Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface.

                    Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems 
                    built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both 
                    desktop and server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel 
                    first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
